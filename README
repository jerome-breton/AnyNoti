This project is a Google Chrome Extension.

Its goal is to provide a unified notification icon merging multiple services.

TODO:
- Work on options screen
- Implement new services (Google Reader, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Generic RSS/Atom, Google Agenda, Linkedin, etc.)
- i18n
- Toasters
- Better icon (transparent if nothing else favicon patchwork ?)
